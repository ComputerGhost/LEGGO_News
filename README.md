# LEGGO_News

This ~~is~~ will be the website https://leggonews.com.

This repo contains the public-facing website, the content management system, the API, and related tools.

## Dev Setup

The latest versions of these softwares are required or assumed:

 * Microsoft Windows
 * Visual Studio with C# compiler
 * SQL Express

After cloning the repo, follow these steps to start the project:

 1. Create a leggo_news database.
 2. Create a leggo_news user for the database table.  The password should be "password".
 3. Run the software for the first time.

Happy coding!

## Contributing

Contributors should be fans of EXID.  This is a special project for them, so it just makes sense to keep it within the fandom.  If you're not a fan yet, just go listen to a few of their B-side songs then come back tomorrow. ;)

Programmers can help us by doing code reviews or by tackling coding tasks.  All of this is on the "Stuff To Do" board.

To pick up a coding ticket:

 1. Visit the "Stuff To Do" project board and peruse the list of items "to do".
 2. After selecting an item, assign it to yourself.
 3. Create a new branch with a good name, and make your changes there.
 4. When finished, do a pull request.

Non-programmers can help us out too!  Are there any problems that you see?  Features that you think we need?  You can create a new issue for it.

## Future Plans

We want our code to go live as soon as it is ready.  We have almost exhausted the capabilities of WordPress with our current live website.  We need this.

This project and its website will be maintained and updated for as long as EXID is active in their careers.  We're never shutting down!  :)
